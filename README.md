## Description

jspsychSurveyUI is a front-end application developed with Next.js to create surveys using the jsPsych library. While the current version doesn't have a functional backend, plans include integrating a backend developed in C# using ASP.NET to manage user authentication and survey progress saving.

## Features

- **Survey Generation:** Utilizes the jsPsych library to create dynamic surveys.
- **Next.js Framework:** Utilizes the benefits of Next.js for efficient rendering and routing.
- **Planned Backend Integration:** Future implementation to handle user creation and progress saving.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** React framework for the front-end application.
- **jsPsych:** Library for creating behavioral experiments in a web browser.
- **Future Backend (C# in ASP.NET):** Planned backend for user management and data storage.
